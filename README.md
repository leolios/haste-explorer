# Haste Explorer
A simple web haste client.

First of all, thank you for giving your attention to this little project that I like very much, then everything will be translated with deepl.com because I'm unfortunately French, and my English is really low ...

And now...

### What is Haste Explorer

It's a client, for the moment web, for all the [haste-servers](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server).
It will contain a file version manager, a list of the files you have created (per server), tools to share your code, synchronization between your different clients, advanced customization, in short, a lot of things that will take me a lot of time!

### Prerequisite

* **Your brain**, you can host or locally access the client ( or just open [this link](github page projet) )
